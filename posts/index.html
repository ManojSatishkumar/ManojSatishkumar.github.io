                    class="card-text"> Today I will address one of the sensitive things that are still being followed in
                    few
                    software companies - "Asking the previous employer payslips before sending offer letter"
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    There are 2 reasons for asking it.
                    <ul>
                        <li>To verify if the candidate is not faking experience.</li>
                        <li>To determine their hike.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br />
                    I'm totally OK with the first one.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    But the second reason separates "Great" companies from "OKish" companies.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Let me explain.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Companies already have certain baselines and slabs of CTC predefined for a given role. I
                    understand negotiation is an art. But deciding the starting CTC based on previous
                    employer salary is something we should reconsider whether to continue doing or not.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    When you ask a selected candidate about his/her expectation, most candidates will say
                    "Industry standard". This is because they value the company overall and believe that the
                    standards are high and on par with the market.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    After this, the moment previous employer payslips are asked, it could damage the
                    reputation a bit.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Just a thought.
                    <br />
                    I'm just trying to express the impact of this sensitive thing.

                    I remember someone commenting on my previous post.
                    <br />
                    "A candle loses nothing by lighting another candle" - It hit me hard.

                    <br />
                    Every day when you wake up, ask yourself the below question.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    If I had a billion dollars in my bank account, what would I do today? If I was the top 1% in the
                    world, what would I do today?
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <strong>
                        You end up with 2 options.
                    </strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            1. Am I going to spend it carelessly?
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            2. Am I going to help someone grow?
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Guess what, if you have chosen the second option, there is no need to wait to become a billionaire.
                    You can get started right now.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Help has many forms. One type of help is monetary. Another type of help is "Lighting another
                    candle".
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    "Lighting another candle" - is a kind of help where you sell your experience for free. You might
                    have gained so much experience in a certain aspect. Give that for free. You will essentially be a
                    philanthropist.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    The ultimate feeling in life is "personal-satisfaction".
                    <br />
                    Not pleasure.

                    class="card-text">
                    With most companies moving to WFH model, interviews over video conferencing have become the only
                    option lately. The world has changed and we software developers love "change" because we have been
                    told that's the only "constant" in our career.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Below are 3 tips you must keep in mind before the interview starts. I assume you have prepared well
                    before this day.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <strong>#1. Join the call on time and turn the webcam ON.</strong>
                    <br />
                    - By turning the webcam ON, you get immediately noticed as most candidates and interviewers will not
                    turn it on. They will focus on you a bit more.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <strong>#2. Keep your favorite code editor handy.</strong>
                    <br />
                    - Few companies will prefer an online editor. But many times, the interviewer may ask you to open in
                    your local machine due to VPN issues. Don't waste time installing it. Keep it ready.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <strong>#3. Keep a sample project ready.</strong>
                    <br />
                    - The last thing you want is getting stuck in setting up a sample project. Don't waste time
                    installing dependencies. Keep the sample project ready where you can quickly code and show the
                    output. If you are in a react.js interview, keep a" hello world" app ready with index.js
                    <br />
                    <br />

                    🤯 React's useEffect( ) is more powerful than I thought.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Many react developers got a taste of "hooks" last year and ever since, it has been hard to go back
                    to class components. I mean, who wants those life cycle methods.. yukkk 😪
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    The very first hook that we learnt was obviously "useState ( )" which allowed us to maintain an
                    internal state for a given react function component.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    👨‍💻 const [ state, setState ] = useState(initialValue);

                    We loved ❤️ the performance it brought as redux state updates are comparatively slower. When I fire
                    a redux action to update the state, I always felt the lag 👎 if I am using that state to render a
                    certain UI component. ( Like opening and closing a Material UI drawer at a rapid rate. Browser
                    freezes after a while ). The last thing I want on my website is a browser freeze 😡
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    But it's always fast with the component's local state 😇
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    The second hook we learnt is useEffect ( );
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    useEffect(() => {
                    <br />
                    // Your code
                    <br />
                    }, [variables]);
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Turns out, this is not just for executing some side effect code. It can control the app UX with so
                    much minimal code 😲

                    I observed a newbie who joined a startup looking happier than a Senior director working at
                    Microsoft.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    When I examined this a little bit, I come to realize many things.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Apparently our inner feeings about our profession depends on the difference between what we want and
                    what we have gained in our professional career.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    The desires of the newbie are so far less that the arithmetic difference yields a numerically
                    positive result of the above thought equation.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Rewind back even more in life and you can see a 3 year old child playing in sand looked full of
                    happiness spilling everywhere he went.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    As we grow up, if we can balance the above arithmetic difference and control our desires, I think
                    the feeling can be sustained.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I don't have any proof for this.
                    <br />
                    Just thought of sharing anyway.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I hope I don't get any message from Senior directors at Microsoft 😅

                    When I was in college, I thought I will be successful if I can get 1st rank.

                    <br />
                    <br />
                    When I was in college, I thought I will be successful if I can get into one of the top 5 companies
                    in the world.

                    <br />
                    At this point,
                    <br />I stopped thinking about a new thing again because its apparent that success is not measured
                    by what I become in life. Success is measured by what I enable others to become in their lives.

                    <br />
                    <br /> You built applications,
                    <br />You created projects,
                    <br /> You crafted architectures,
                    <br /> You polished your products.
                    <br />

                    <br />You spent hours and hours,

                    Think about an Nvidia card.

                    <br />
                    Think about your phone.
                    <br /> Would you use it if it lags ? Its the performance that makes you use it more.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Why should your customers adjust with how the page is performing ?

                    ⏳ Once upon a time, long long ago, a certain 🌐 #web👨‍💻#developers used ⚛️ #React class components
                    to build web applications.
                    <br /> They were not happy 😕 with how much 🤦‍♂️cluttered their #code used to be due to the life
                    cycle methods as components became bigger and bigger 🎡
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    🤞But there was a ray of hope that one day there will come a 🦸 ⚛️🦸 set of #programmers from
                    #javascript community who would change everything and bring #simplicity to their lives.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    And finally, on February 16, 2019, the 🎉miracle so happened in the form of "hooks" and finally
                    developers 💔ditched class components and lived 😊happily with function components thereafter.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Even today, we 🍷remember those warriors who survived the 🕓age of react class components and their
                    journey can only be found in sacred books📚 called medium blogs.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    The End ❤️
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Ok... Jokes apart 😅,
                    <br /> I'm pleased that hooks came into my career and they truly changed the way component-based
                    applications are built today. Now I see so many different implementation patterns that developers
                    are coming up with and in some cases exploiting React hooks.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    One such great example is React DnD - drag and drop based library and I just enjoy such APIs that I
                    can take advantage of in real projects.

                    <br />
                    <br />
                    As we grow in our careers, we don't just accumulate professional experiences. We actually gather
                    psychological, philosophical, and cultural experiences as well. And believe me, these will far
                    surpass the professional experience over time.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    For most passionate people, what started as a "job" after college turns into "passion" and then
                    turns into "Art".
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I believe the key factor in turning your "job" into your "art" is your attention to detail in
                    basically whatever you do in your career. I would even go as far as saying it is the key aspect of
                    our lives.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Just picture a mother paying attention to her child. The child would see the outside world and then
                    notice how much the mother is paying attention to what he is doing. I believe these entities are
                    directly proportional to each other ( with few exceptions of course )
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    For every activity you do in life, there is no top ceiling for how much attention you can dedicate
                    to it. The more you put, the better it becomes - It can be your job, relationship, business,
                    personality, lifestyle, etc.,
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Art is the ultimate expression. And to make your job an art involves careful thought and attention.
                    There is no activity that you believe matters will go in vain.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    All the best 👍

                    Does the future look bright with the interview process followed by most of the software companies
                    today?
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Well, maybe...but can there be a better way? let's find out.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I have been interviewing candidates for the past 4 years in various software companies for various
                    roles. And just like you, I have also given interviews as a candidate which got me the jobs I wanted
                    in my career till now.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    But I somehow feel the process is getting old school.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    The same old DS, Algo & Problem solving rounds, the same old one-sided interrogation trying to
                    measure a candidate.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I think times are changing and machines are becoming powerful, our life is getting more organized
                    than ever. Systems are getting more efficient than ever before. And I see that human psychology also
                    has changed a lot. We don't talk too much like we used to and we have found various ways to get
                    things done fast with minimal interaction.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Let me give you 1 example.
                    <br /> Consider an interviewer who is confident to interview a candidate in a technical round. Do
                    you think he/she will have the same confidence if the seats are swapped?
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I bet the answer is No.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    So definitely we need different measuring sticks in the future. We should find out the hidden talent
                    and not try to put pressure for 45 mins and judge based on that.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Agree?

                    We all are looking for opportunities and one of the best ways to get one is to "ask". Yes, "asking"
                    is powerful but we should understand how to get things done as well.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I'm giving you the Do's ✅ and Dont's ❌ while asking a job referral from your LinkedIn connection. Or
                    if you don't have a connection, earning one as well.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    The Dont's: ❌
                    <br />Remember that you need something and not them. So please don't just send a 1 liner message
                    like "can you refer me ?". Also, don't start the conversation with such lines. Remember that they
                    are also employees like you and they have priorities. Don't directly send the Job ID without even
                    introducing yourself or mentioning your past accomplishments/ current skills.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    The Do's: ✅
                    <br /> Always start with a greeting and respect their time. Just ask how was their day and if they
                    are open for a quick chat. If you have seen some of their content on LinkedIn, acknowledge it. After
                    that instead of sending a huge message with Job ID, start introducing yourself and mention that you
                    are interested in their organisation. Then explain a little bit about your past accomplishments.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Now is your chance to search online and find the Job ID.
                    <br /> Also send a URL link of the JD so that it's easy for them.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    All the best guys. 👍

                    <br />
                    I believe education is not just about reading books or going to a lab for practical experiences.
                    Education should involve things that tend to matter when we grow up and realise . Education should
                    answer certain questions and show a clear path where there is confusion.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Most importantly, about how to control our brain from losing direction.
