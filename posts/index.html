                        When you were in college,
                        <br/>
                        you wanted a job.
                        <br/> <br/>
                        When you got a job in service-based company,
                        <br/>
                        You wanted product-based.
                        <br/> <br/>
                        When you got 5 LPA package,
                        <br/>
                        you wanted 20 LPA.
                        <br/> <br/>
                        When you got 25 LPA,
                        <br/>
                        You wanted 40 LPA.
                        <br/> <br/>
                        When you got 50 LPA CTC,
                        <br/>
                        you wanted 50 LPA Fixed.
                        <br/> <br/>
                        When you got 60 LPA fixed,
                        <br/>
                        You wanted to build a startup.
                        <br/> <br/>
                        When you got successful in that,
                        <br/>
                        you wanted early retirement.
                        <br/> <br/>
                        When you retired early,
                        <br/>
                        you wanted unlimited passive income.
                        <br/> <br/>
                        When you got everything you ever wanted,
                        <br/>
                        You wanted time to enjoy it.
                        <br/> <br/> <br/>
                        Hence,
                        <br/> <br/>
                        Time is your most valuable asset and it cannot be equated with your earnings. Enjoy your 20s and 30s by both working hard and playing hard. Feel the satisfaction of hitting milestones. The finish line is not really important.
                        <br/> <br/>
                        Achieve your own goals ( Not society's expectations )
                        <br/>
                        You don't need to prove anything to anyone but yourself.
                        <br/> <br/>
                        Nobody is measuring you, they are busy in their lives.
                        <br/>
                        You are the only opponent to yourself in this battle.
                        <br/> <br/>
                        The sooner you realize this,
                        <br/>
                        Your priorities start to change.
                        <br/> <br/>
                        Life becomes meaningful.

                        A butterfly is a beautiful creature,
                        <br/>
                        But it only lives for a few weeks.
                        <br/><br/>
                        A rainbow is a beautiful phenomenon,
                        <br/>
                        But it only lasts about 90 seconds.
                        <br/><br/>
                        A falling comet is a beautiful event,
                        <br/>
                        But it is visible for only a few minutes.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Suppose these events occurred for a longer period of time, we humans have the tendency to categorize them as "normal" things and suddenly they don't look beautiful anymore. Suddenly their value is decreased.
                        <br/><br/>
                        As you grow in your career, your value will also be measured with the amount of time you take to complete any given task. Your value should increase as you get more experienced because you develop greater brainpower.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Unlike your body ( which becomes weak as you age ), your brain keeps getting powerful the longer you live. Your brain's capacity to comprehend the concepts and techniques will get faster.
                        <br/><br/>
                        This is the nature of the human brain.
                        <br/>
                        There is no upper limit for its capabilities.
                        <br/><br/>
                        So when you value your time and spend it wisely,
                        <br/>
                        you will look beautiful and valuable.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Please plan your day before starting your work.

                        The fundamental difference between the "so-called" Rich, the "real" Rich, the Middle-class, and the Poor, is their behaviour towards society.
                        <br/>
                        The Poor don't really bother about what other's think.
                        <br/>
                        They just focus on making a living.
                        <br/><br/>
                        The Middle-class are under constant social pressure.
                        <br/>
                        They are in the rat race.
                        <br/><br/>
                        The "so-called" Rich wants to prove that they possess.
                        <br/>
                        They always want to look better.
                        <br/><br/>
                        But
                        <br/><br/>
                        The "real" Rich again, don't bother what other's think.
                        <br/>
                        They focus on what matters.
                        <br/><br/>
                        So we can safely conclude that social pressure is not something you should be worried about. You want to get out of that middle spectrum as soon as possible.
                        <br/><br/>
                        The real pressure is when you are not satisfied with the achievements that you had defined earlier for yourself. That's a real problem which needs your keen attention.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Rest doesn't matter.

                        class="card-text">
                        You might have heard about CTC 
                        <br/>( Cost To Company )
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        But are you aware of your VTC ?
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        Before offering you a job, companies will often try to ask your expectations and then based on your current CTC, they will determine what you will be worth and then present you with the final numbers. You are then asked to either accept it or negotiate it further.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        But I am creating a new term called VTC ( Value To Company ).
                        <br/>
                        I'm talking about the value you will provide to the employer.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        But who can determine your VTC and how ?
                        <br/> <br/>
                        Nobody in the world can determine your VTC but yourself. And your current CTC has nothing to do with your VTC. You might be underpaid or overpaid ( depends ). But I'm trying to tell you that the intrinsic value of your VTC is an entity that can never be measured by an external entity.
                        <br/> <br/>
                        So the next time you get into a CTC negotiation, always try to negotiate based on what you believe your VTC actually is.
                        <br/> <br/>
                        I am deriving the below formula as a result.
                        <br/> <br/>
                        Let the company's offer = o( CTC )
                        <br/>
                        Let your absolute VTC = y( VTC )
                        <br/>
                        Let the intrinsic value add = V
                        <br/> <br/>
                        Now,
                        <br/> <br/>
                        y( VTC ) = o( CTC ) + V
                        <br/> <br/>
                        Always remember,
                        <br/>
                        Nobody in the world can measure the intrinsic value of "V" but yourself. This intrinsic value keeps growing exponentially as you progress in your career and acquire new skills.
                        <br/> <br/>
                        I could have just said it in plain English but I felt making it a mathematical expression will get your attention better 🙂

                        followed in
                        few
                        software companies - "Asking the previous employer payslips before sending offer letter"
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        There are 2 reasons for asking it.
                        <ul>
                            <li>To verify if the candidate is not faking experience.</li>
                            <li>To determine their hike.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br />
                        I'm totally OK with the first one.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        But the second reason separates "Great" companies from "OKish" companies.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Let me explain.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Companies already have certain baselines and slabs of CTC predefined for a given role. I
                        understand negotiation is an art. But deciding the starting CTC based on previous
                        employer salary is something we should reconsider whether to continue doing or not.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        When you ask a selected candidate about his/her expectation, most candidates will say
                        "Industry standard". This is because they value the company overall and believe that the
                        standards are high and on par with the market.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        After this, the moment previous employer payslips are asked, it could damage the
                        reputation a bit.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Just a thought.
                        <br />
                        I'm just trying to express the impact of this sensitive thing.

                        <br />
                        Every day when you wake up, ask yourself the below question.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        If I had a billion dollars in my bank account, what would I do today? If I was the top 1% in the
                        world, what would I do today?
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <strong>
                            You end up with 2 options.
                        </strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                1. Am I going to spend it carelessly?
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                2. Am I going to help someone grow?
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Guess what, if you have chosen the second option, there is no need to wait to become a
                        billionaire.
                        You can get started right now.

                        Help has many forms. One type of help is monetary. Another type of help is "Lighting another
                        candle".
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        "Lighting another candle" - is a kind of help where you sell your experience for free. You might
                        have gained so much experience in a certain aspect. Give that for free. You will essentially be
                        a
                        philanthropist.

                        <br />
                        Below are 3 tips you must keep in mind before the interview starts. I assume you have prepared
                        well
                        before this day.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <strong>#1. Join the call on time and turn the webcam ON.</strong>
                        <br />
                        - By turning the webcam ON, you get immediately noticed as most candidates and interviewers will
                        not
                        turn it on. They will focus on you a bit more.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <strong>#2. Keep your favorite code editor handy.</strong>
                        <br />
                        - Few companies will prefer an online editor. But many times, the interviewer may ask you to
                        open in
                        your local machine due to VPN issues. Don't waste time installing it. Keep it ready.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <strong>#3. Keep a sample project ready.</strong>
                        <br />
                        - The last thing you want is getting stuck in setting up a sample project. Don't waste time
                        installing dependencies. Keep the sample project ready where you can quickly code and show the
                        output. If you are in a react.js interview, keep a" hello world" app ready with index.js
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        All the best 👍

                        🤯 React's useEffect( ) is more powerful than I thought.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Many react developers got a taste of "hooks" last year and ever since, it has been hard to go
                        back
                        to class components. I mean, who wants those life cycle methods.. yukkk 😪
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        The very first hook that we learnt was obviously "useState ( )" which allowed us to maintain an
                        internal state for a given react function component.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        👨‍💻 const [ state, setState ] = useState(initialValue);
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        We loved ❤️ the performance it brought as redux state updates are comparatively slower. When I
                        fire
                        a redux action to update the state, I always felt the lag 👎 if I am using that state to render
                        a
                        certain UI component. ( Like opening and closing a Material UI drawer at a rapid rate. Browser
                        freezes after a while ). The last thing I want on my website is a browser freeze 😡
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        But it's always fast with the component's local state 😇
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        The second hook we learnt is useEffect ( );
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        useEffect(() => {
                        <br />
                        // Your code
                        <br />
                        }, [variables]);
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Turns out, this is not just for executing some side effect code. It can control the app UX with
                        so
                        much minimal code 😲

                        I observed a newbie who joined a startup looking happier than a Senior director working at
                        Microsoft.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        When I examined this a little bit, I come to realize many things.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Apparently our inner feeings about our profession depends on the difference between what we want
                        and
                        what we have gained in our professional career.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        The desires of the newbie are so far less that the arithmetic difference yields a numerically
                        positive result of the above thought equation.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Rewind back even more in life and you can see a 3 year old child playing in sand looked full of
                        happiness spilling everywhere he went.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        As we grow up, if we can balance the above arithmetic difference and control our desires, I
                        think
                        the feeling can be sustained.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        I don't have any proof for this.
                        <br />
                        Just thought of sharing anyway.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        I hope I don't get any message from Senior directors at Microsoft 😅

                        When I was in college, I thought I will be successful if I can get 1st rank.
                        <br />I got it finally but I realized late how selfish of a thought it really was.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        When I was in college, I thought I will be successful if I can get into one of the top 5
                        companies
                        in the world.
                        <br /> But now I realized late how selfish of a thought it really was.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        At this point,
                        <br />I stopped thinking about a new thing again because its apparent that success is not
                        measured
                        by what I become in life. Success is measured by what I enable others to become in their lives.

                        <br />
                        So correction of history is not possible now due to the laws of physics but atleast future is in
                        my
                        control.

                        If you are in a company implementing a website and your product team is putting all kinds of

                        Think about a Lamborghini.
                        <br /> Would you like it just for the looks ? It's the performance of the vehicle that drives
                        you
                        nuts when you think about it.

                        performance that gives you goosebumps while hitting N2O in Need for speed.

                        <br /> Would you use it if it lags ? Its the performance that makes you use it more.
                        <br />
                        <br />

                        ⏳ Once upon a time, long long ago, a certain 🌐 #web👨‍💻#developers used ⚛️ #React class
                        components
                        to build web applications.
                        <br /> They were not happy 😕 with how much 🤦‍♂️cluttered their #code used to be due to the
                        life
                        cycle methods as components became bigger and bigger 🎡
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        🤞But there was a ray of hope that one day there will come a 🦸 ⚛️🦸 set of #programmers from
                        #javascript community who would change everything and bring #simplicity to their lives.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        And finally, on February 16, 2019, the 🎉miracle so happened in the form of "hooks" and finally
                        developers 💔ditched class components and lived 😊happily with function components thereafter.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Even today, we 🍷remember those warriors who survived the 🕓age of react class components and
                        their
                        journey can only be found in sacred books📚 called medium blogs.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        The End ❤️
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Ok... Jokes apart 😅,
                        <br /> I'm pleased that hooks came into my career and they truly changed the way component-based
                        applications are built today. Now I see so many different implementation patterns that
                        developers
                        are coming up with and in some cases exploiting React hooks.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        One such great example is React DnD - drag and drop based library and I just enjoy such APIs
                        that I
                        can take advantage of in real projects.

                        <br />
                        <br />
                        As we grow in our careers, we don't just accumulate professional experiences. We actually gather
                        psychological, philosophical, and cultural experiences as well. And believe me, these will far
                        surpass the professional experience over time.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        For most passionate people, what started as a "job" after college turns into "passion" and then
                        turns into "Art".
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        I believe the key factor in turning your "job" into your "art" is your attention to detail in
                        basically whatever you do in your career. I would even go as far as saying it is the key aspect
                        of
                        our lives.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Just picture a mother paying attention to her child. The child would see the outside world and
                        then
                        notice how much the mother is paying attention to what he is doing. I believe these entities are
                        directly proportional to each other ( with few exceptions of course )
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        For every activity you do in life, there is no top ceiling for how much attention you can
                        dedicate
                        to it. The more you put, the better it becomes - It can be your job, relationship, business,
                        personality, lifestyle, etc.,
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Art is the ultimate expression. And to make your job an art involves careful thought and
                        attention.
                        There is no activity that you believe matters will go in vain.

                        Does the future look bright with the interview process followed by most of the software

                        today?

                        Well, maybe...but can there be a better way? let's find out.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        I have been interviewing candidates for the past 4 years in various software companies for
                        various
                        roles. And just like you, I have also given interviews as a candidate which got me the jobs I
                        wanted
                        in my career till now.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        But I somehow feel the process is getting old school.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        The same old DS, Algo & Problem solving rounds, the same old one-sided interrogation trying to
                        measure a candidate.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        I think times are changing and machines are becoming powerful, our life is getting more
                        organized
                        than ever. Systems are getting more efficient than ever before. And I see that human psychology
                        also
                        has changed a lot. We don't talk too much like we used to and we have found various ways to get
                        things done fast with minimal interaction.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Let me give you 1 example.
                        <br /> Consider an interviewer who is confident to interview a candidate in a technical round.
                        Do
                        you think he/she will have the same confidence if the seats are swapped?
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        I bet the answer is No.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        So definitely we need different measuring sticks in the future. We should find out the hidden
                        talent
                        and not try to put pressure for 45 mins and judge based on that.

                        The Dont's: ❌
                        <br />Remember that you need something and not them. So please don't just send a 1 liner message
                        like "can you refer me ?". Also, don't start the conversation with such lines. Remember that
                        they
                        are also employees like you and they have priorities. Don't directly send the Job ID without
                        even
                        introducing yourself or mentioning your past accomplishments/ current skills.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        The Do's: ✅
                        <br /> Always start with a greeting and respect their time. Just ask how was their day and if
                        they
                        are open for a quick chat. If you have seen some of their content on LinkedIn, acknowledge it.
                        After
                        that instead of sending a huge message with Job ID, start introducing yourself and mention that
                        you
                        are interested in their organisation. Then explain a little bit about your past accomplishments.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Now is your chance to search online and find the Job ID.
                        <br /> Also send a URL link of the JD so that it's easy for them.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        All the best guys. 👍

                        <br />
                        <br />
                        I believe education is not just about reading books or going to a lab for practical experiences.
                        Education should involve things that tend to matter when we grow up and realise . Education
                        should
                        answer certain questions and show a clear path where there is confusion.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Most importantly, about how to control our brain from losing direction.
