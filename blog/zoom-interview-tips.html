                                        interview process. I want to help you crack those interviews by providing you

                                        With most companies moving to work from home model, interviews over video
                                        conferencing ( especially over zoom ) have become the only option lately. The
                                        world has changed and we software developers love "change" because we were told
                                        that's the only "constant" in our career.<span

                                        Traditionally, interviews have been mostly face-2-face. A few years ago, when I
                                        was continuously giving interviews, I was asked to write code on a whiteboard
                                        and express my approach to the problem with a touch of body language. But
                                        nowadays, since our lives are pretty much virtual, it's kind of hard to express
                                        what you are thinking about. Especially if you have not turned on the
                                        webcam.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
                                    <p class="p2" style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: large; color: black">
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="p3" style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: large; color: black">
                                        Speaking of expressing what you are thinking, when the interviewer presents you
                                        with a problem, you should never ever jump directly to coding. You should first
                                        explain your approach to the problem and give a pause, then wait till you get an
                                        acknowledgement from the interviewer if he is ok with the approach. if the
                                        interviewer says - “yes” or “go ahead”, then you are sure that the approach you
                                        just explained is what the interviewer is looking at. Now your coding is worth
                                        spending time. Remember, time is limited in the interview. And speed is
                                        everything.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>

                                        There are high chances that the HR is probably arranging the zoom interview for
                                        you as a host and they might start breakout rooms ( a feature available on zoom
                                        ) as candidates join one by one on the interview drive day. Make sure you turn
                                        the Webcam ON. By doing so, you get immediately noticed as most candidates and
                                        interviewers will not turn it on. Now, before turning it ON, I want you to
                                        choose a place where light is directed towards your face ( sit in front of a
                                        window ). You probably know that most laptop webcams are bad. So proper lighting
                                        is your only option here.<b></b></p>

                                        have been looking at the computer screen all day probably. This tendency has
                                        come due to the biological history of living organisms - human faces get
                                        attention over machine screens naturally.</p>

                                        may ask you to open in your local machine due to VPN issues, blocked websites or
                                        maybe they want to see how you set up the coding environment and get your hands
                                        in the terminal. Either way, you will need to set up and keep your IDE handy. In

                                        Time is money when it comes to interviews. The faster you write code and arrive

                                            solutions to the given problems. The speed at which you think and the depth
                                            of your thought process is also taken into account in this limited time of

                                            editor you use on daily basis due to muscle memory. So take a shot in the
                                            dark and ask the interviewer if you can use your local editor to write code
                                            and show the results. Unless there are company restrictions, the interviewer
                                            will probably agree for the request. I am saying this because I have agreed
                                            to this in many zoom interviews and I found out that the candidates write
                                            code very fast in their local machine than online editors. At any cost, I do
                                            not want to judge them just because they felt uncomfortable in some other
                                            code editor. I know that some companies still use google docs to write code.
                                            I don't prefer it personally due to indentation issues and the absence of
                                            syntax highlighting. Nonetheless, you need to be prepared and definitely ask
                                            the interviewer if you can use your local machine in the interview.</span>

                                        The last thing you want is getting stuck in setting up a sample project during

                                        this enough. Even today, when I am taking interviews, I still see candidates
                                        starting from scratch when I ask them to execute a sample javascript code or to
                                        write a sample react component implementing a certain feature and show the
                                        output their machine.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>It would
                                        have easily saved 10 minutes of time if a sample bootstrap was already ready so
                                        that the candidate can focus only on the problem. Some companies do allow online
                                        editors that come with a built-in setup to quickly get started. But as a
                                        candidate, don't take this chance. Just keep a sample React project ( a blank
                                        create-react-app ) and make sure Node is installed in your machine. You can just
                                        directly execute Javascript code with Node and show the output.</p>

                                        Another most important thing that I want to bring is about installing
                                        dependencies. Don't just set up the project files before the interview. You must
                                        also install all the dependencies that the project demands. Don't waste time
                                        installing these. The reason why I am stressing on this aspect is because I have
                                        personally seen candidates spending time and in worst cases, their wifi
                                        connectivity gives issues during the interview. And I see them getting into a
                                        panic because of this unexpected situation which has no value in the interview.
                                        It will only lessen the candidate's chances of getting selected.</p>

                                        In most online interviews, there will definitely be a coding round. Especially
                                        if the role is for a software engineer ( doesn't matter which level ) coding is
                                        a mandatory skill and every company will measure the candidate based on various
                                        aspects of coding. But you must always keep in mind that before coding, the
                                        interviewer is interested in the way you think when a problem is presented to
                                        you. They want to know how and why you chose an approach to solve the problem
                                        and after that, they will assess you in how well you write code that actually
                                        solves the problem by producing the desired output.</p>

                                        So in the zoom call,<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>after the
                                        interviewer presents you the problem, you need to carefully read the problem and
                                        start asking questions back to the interviewer if something is not clear. Don't
                                        jump into coding. Break the problem into understandable statements and clarify
                                        your doubts. The more clarifications you ask, the more it feels like you care
                                        about providing the right solution and what the interviewer is expecting. Trust
                                        me, if you want to crack the interview, you need to read the interviewer's mind
                                        and picture what they are expecting from you. You can get this picture only by
                                        asking questions and by getting more clarity. Don't think the interviewer will
                                        get irritated if you keep asking clarification questions. It is also one of the
                                        aspects they are looking in you.</p>

                                        Your next step is to explain your approach to solve the problem. The approach
                                        should not be a brute force method. Take a step back and fully explain your
                                        approach and then ask the interviewer if he is ok with the approach and if you
                                        can start coding. Now, if the interviewer says <b>"go ahead"</b> or <b>"start
                                            coding"</b> then you can be sure that this is his expectation and your code
                                        will have value once you write it. And if the interviewer said <b>"can you think
                                            of a different approach ?"</b>, then it saved your coding time because now
                                        you have the opportunity to think about a different approach and you did not
                                        waste time coding a wrong approach to begin with.</p>

                                        This point is not just for zoom interviews, but it is essential in general. It
                                        matters in zoom the most because another candidate will be waiting after your
                                        zoom call and it cannot be postponed like in an onsite interview.<span
                                            class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;Nowadays, due to WFH, I am seeing
                                            meetings are getting started at the exact time. If there is another meeting
                                            during the end of one meeting, I see participants post a message in zoom
                                            chat saying - "Need to drop to attend another call" and then they drop off.
                                            The situation has changed and our work timings are kind of becoming strict
                                            since we are not wasting time running from one meeting room to another.
                                            While this looks like a boon and it feels like we are teleporting at
                                            supersonic speed 😅, it can be problematic as well due to strict timing
                                            being followed. Nonetheless, this is the new normal and we need to adjust
                                            with it and move on.</span></p>
