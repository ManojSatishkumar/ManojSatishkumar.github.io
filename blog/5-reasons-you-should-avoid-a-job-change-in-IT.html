                  <h4>Dear reader,</h3>
                    <br />
                    If you are here, you probably have decided to change your company due to a certain reason but you're
                    still
                    not sure whether you want to make this move or not. You are still asking yourself whether you should
                    re-consider staying in your current company. Yes, I understand what you're going through. I've gone
                    through it too and I had to take a few decisions that have helped me in my career so far. Keep
                    reading
                    and
                    hopefully, you can make a decision in the end.

                      <span class="s1">If you thought about this, you would have thought of changing your job because of
                        these
                        reasons :</span>

                    <div class="p1" style="text-align: left;">
                      <span class="s1">So you come to know that some of your co-workers left your company and joined
                        somewhere
                        else. If they are a bit closer to you, you would have probably asked them where did they join,
                        why
                        they
                        left your company and what is their new pay scale. This is very common behavior and it happens
                        with
                        all of
                        us. But after inquiring all these details, when you come to know about the benefits that they
                        got
                        after
                        joining the new company, you sometimes felt that you are missing out on certain
                        opportunities.&nbsp;</span>

                    <div class="p1" style="text-align: left;">
                      <span class="s1">The first thing that you want to do is to stop comparing yourself with others.
                        The
                        more
                        you
                        compare yourself with others the more you want to become them. It could be that they are
                        actually
                        lying to
                        you and trying to cover up with a certain situation or they are just trying to influence you and
                        also
                        want
                        you to leave the company as well. They could've got a low salary increase and they just don't
                        want
                        to
                        let
                        you know. Even if they are very close to you people don't let go off their personal things
                        outside
                        especially when it comes their professionalism so enquire once and do not take a decision
                        immediately.<br />

                      <span class="s1">Maybe you would have decided to leave your current company because you think that
                        a
                        recent
                        happening in your company with you is not good. You might have had a hard conversation with your
                        manager
                        or you might have fought with your colleagues which has led to this decision. You could've taken
                        things
                        personally where they shouldn't have been. So you went home and you start thinking if it will be
                        better to
                        leave this company and join another company.</span>

                    </div>
                    <div class="p1" style="text-align: left;">
                      <span class="s1">Running away from a problem or leaving the existing company may not be the
                        solution
                        all
                        the
                        time. You will never know what kind of situations could arise in the new company. Maybe you will
                        run
                        across the same set of situations again. Or maybe the situations can even get worse. You cannot
                        predict
                        what it's going to happen in the future. Even if the new company is very good and it is paying
                        you
                        really
                        well you will not know what kind of situations can cause you to lose your peace. If you have
                        decided
                        to
                        leave your company because of fighting with your manager you might get an even worse manager the
                        future.
                        So don't&nbsp;decide&nbsp;immediately after a bad situation. Instead, go home think about it and
                        come
                        the
                        other day with your decision.<br />

                      <span class="s1">Like I mentioned earlier you might have seen your colleagues leaving your company
                        in
                        the
                        interest of the higher pay scale given by another company. You then realize that the current pay
                        scale
                        that you are getting from your current company is not enough for your lifestyle. You just want
                        to
                        live
                        a
                        better life and you want to increase your lifestyle limits and expenses. The more money you have
                        the
                        more
                        things you can buy. This is also one of the reasons or side effects which I mentioned

                        want. Maybe you don't need that much money to be happy. Is happiness the priority to you or

                        Is
                        your

                        no
                        need to change your job or your company. You just wanted it but you don't really need it. If you
                        really
                        want to earn more money there other ways to do so. You can start your own blog or you can do a

                        bit
                        of freelancing. This will also ensure that you get an additional income without changing your

                        performance.
                        Ask yourself the question if you really have a way to get along with your current management. Is
                        it
                        good
                        for your career if you change and become an individual contributor. Once you answer these
                        questions
                        I'm
                        sure that you will find a way to get along. I'm not asking you to agree to whatever they say.
                        I'm
                        just
                        asking you to listen to yourself and try to find a way to manage your management. Your
                        management
                        will
                        listen to you and award you with the opportunities that you need.<br />

                        Ask yourself the question is anything stopping you from implementing these latest technologies
                        in
                        the
