                    certain qualities and have hit certain milestones in your short career.

                    <br />
                    There could be various reasons why the management would feel the need to send a junior employee
                    abroad
                    and you will need to understand what they are looking for before you express your aspiration to
                    travel.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Keep reading this post, You will start to realize what you need to do to earn one.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Onsite / Travel opportunity to abroad ( a business trip ) is something that software engineers in
                    India
                    look forward to all the time. This is because there are a lot of benefits traveling abroad and
                    working
                    there for some time.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Some of the benefits of traveling on a business trip are :
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    1. You get to meet people from different countries and learn about their culture.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    2. You develop connections with different people working over there.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    3. You gain experience..... and a lot more.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    But the real problem is that you will not be sent for a business trip by just working like everyone
                    else.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    You need to demonstrate certain things and then you will be considered for a travel. ( politics
                    aside
                    )
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Below are some of the things that are very important and you should demonstrate them in your career
                    to
                    earn a travel opportunity as a software engineer / a developer.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    1. You need to demonstrate that you communicate well with stakeholders and other employees.
                    Always remember, the one who communicates very effectively is highly trusted by management and they
                    tend
                    to listen to what the person has to say. You will need to demonstrate this through various platforms
                    and
                    opportunities.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    For example,
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    1. You can constantly present in meetups, tech sessions, and other occasions.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    2. You need to constantly update the management about what you are doing in an effective manner.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    3. Communicate well with some employees sitting in other countries and obtain a good feedback from
                    them.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Being able to communicate well also demonstrates your self-confidence.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    2. You should have contributed a major part in the project.
                    Listen, nobody will send you abroad if you're just doing small bug fixes. You should demonstrate
                    concrete technical skills and you should contribute a lot to the overall project.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    You should be a key member of the team.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    You must have written a lot of code / should have introduced a process change that enhanced the
                    system.
                    You will then be noticed in your team and the management. They will reach out to you for a travel to
                    get
                    work done abroad as well.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    3. You must have developed a good relationship with co-workers & management.
                    If you are not maintaining a good relationship and constantly creating some trouble, the management
                    will
                    reject your aspiration to travel right away.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    This is because they want the person who travels abroad to develop good relationships with the
                    employees
                    working in that country also.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Good relationships are always beneficial to the project / team.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    4. You must have gained trust in the team & from the management.
                    If the management trusts that you have the ability to get the job done, they will offer you a travel
                    opportunity.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I know, developing trust is a long time process but there are various things you can do to quickly
                    gain
                    the trust in the team.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Some of them are:
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    1. Constantly completing work on or before the deadline.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    2. You should always be available to resolve roadblocks.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    3. Showing interest and staying focused on the project goals, milestones, and activities.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    5. You should know about the overall project, the goals, timelines, and the roadmap
                    If you do not know about the project roadmap in detail, what value are you adding by your travel?
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    The management thinks in this direction :
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    1. What's the value add by sending this employee?
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    2. Is the project going to be successful?
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    3. Will the person bring constructive changes in the project?
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    4. Is the person knowledgeable to answer / make project related high level decisions while in
                    abroad?
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    If the answer to these question is a yes, then you will be chosen for a business trip.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Conclusion:
                    That being said,
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Traveling abroad should be considered as a value add to the project / the team.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    If there is no value, you will not be sent no matter how many times you demand it. (again, politics
                    aside)
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    You should be that person who will bring the change to the project and add value to the system by
                    traveling abroad. You should be confident about getting high-level project work done.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    So go and make a difference in the project, try to be a key member in the team and you will be
                    considered for a business travel.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Good luck,
