                  <h4>Dear reader,</h3>
                    <br />
                    <div>
                      Have you ever wondered how you can save time? Let me ask you a different question, Have you ever
                      spent
                      time to actually think about saving time? Well, it looks like time is the most valuable asset that
                      we
                      all have in our lives. And yet we spend it without thinking. Think about this. Do you spend money
                      without thinking? Then why would you spend time?
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      Time spent not doing productive things is as good as losing money. Because time actually evaluates
                      to
                      the number of assets you obtain in your life. Spend time wisely to accumulate wealth. Spending
                      less
                      time
                      on various things can help you get time to maintain your health. Health is really important in our
                      lives. If you lose health, you lose everything.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      Successful people all over the world have their own tricks to save time. You see, you can’t be
                      really
                      successful if you're doing repetitive tasks every day. You have to find those little hacks that
                      save
                      time. When you do, you actually end up doing a lot more productive work than you will ever
                      imagine.
                      <br />
                    
                    <br />
                      For instance, if you take all of the texting that you do on a daily basis and convert them to
                      keyboard
                      shortcuts, you will end up saving a lot of time. Time is wealth. Time is health as wealth.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      Multitasking is really useful. I'm not denying it. But multitasking on a daily basis too much can
                      actually reduce your productivity. There are some things that you want to multitask but there're
                      other
                      things you don't want to.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      For example, you want to listen to music and an audiobook perhaps while you do exercise in the
                      gym.
                      But
                      you don't want to constantly check emails when you're programming or doing some task that requires
                      continuous focus. You don't want to constantly chit chat with your colleagues when you're doing
                      actual
                      core work in the office.
                      <br />
                    
                    <br />
                      Another example,
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      You would want to read a book when you're travelling in a taxi. But you don't want to just
                      Facebook
                      or
                      listen to songs when you're travelling for four hours. In various metro cities, if you really
                      think,
                      you’re actually spending more time travelling. And so, you want to save time and do multitasking
                      in
                      times like these. You could read a book about increasing productivity or a book about personal
                      finance
                      during this non-productive trip. You could also do some coding if you are programmer during this
                      time.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      Another way to boost your productivity is by utilising speech to text recognition software's in
                      Mac,
                      Windows and other operating systems.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      If you're using a Mac or an Apple device, Siri can help you save a ton of time translating all
                      your
                      speech into text. Whether it be a writing a blog post or just jotting down some notes, you can
                      always
                      use speech to text recognition to do things for you. This actually saves time because you could
                      never
                      type as fast as you speak for most of you out there. Some people actually blame Siri for not being
                      very
                      accurate but this is a very useful feature provided by Siri and I found it to be extremely
                      accurate
                      in
                      this area. In fact, this entire blog post is not written. I am speaking and Siri is writing it for
                      me.
                      After the entire post is written. I will just cross-check if there are any errors and correct
                      them.
                      <br />
                      
                      <br />
                      If you're on the Mac, you can also save time by automating tasks. There's a building tool and Mac
                      and
                      it's called the Automator. Automator can do a ton of work for you when you're not using the Mac.
                      You
                      can
                      open multiple websites at once. You can run a bunch of bash commands. You can even open multiple
                      apps
                      at
                      once. Configure Automator with voice narration, you'll be able to do all this just by talking to
                      your
                      Mac. It is one of those powerful tools I found to be very useful when I want to take brakes, save
                      time
                      and rest for a while when my eyes are strained due to work.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      In one of the future blog posts, I will show you how Automator can get all the routine tasks done
                      without even you touching the keyboard.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      You should also avoid working for very long hours. Try doing this the next time. Work for 25
                      minutes
                      and
                      take a break for 5 minutes. Continue is for one full day and compare your productivity with the
                      previous
                      day. If you have seen improvement in your productivity then comment on this blog post and tell me
                      how.
