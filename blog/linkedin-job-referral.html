                <h4>Dear reader,</h3>
                  <br />
                  <p><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: large; color: black">As an interviewer myself,
                      &nbsp;I get so many chat messages
                      on LinkedIn from job seekers asking for a referral. While it is extremely difficult to reply to
                      all of them, I do look at some of them every now and then. Unknowingly, few messages and
                      profiles catch my attention and I dig deeper into profiles. Internet is a powerful place and a
                      tool to use. It has changed the world forever. It has changed the way people meet, get
                      opportunities and also make a living for themselves.</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: large; color: black">Like I said, due to many
                      chat messages, I sometimes miss
                      many requests. So I wanted to bring a better solution to this problem. I started the MSK
                      Referral program to keep track of the people asking for a job referral. Nonetheless, I think it
                      is important that you understand few key things before asking for a job referral from other
                      interviewers, HRs, and employees on LinkedIn.</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: large; color: black">Back in those days, when I
                      was searching for a job at one
                      of the Fortune Top 10 companies, I wish I was aware of the mistakes that I was doing before
                      asking for a job referral from an employee working in the company I wanted to work for. &nbsp;So
                      I decided to write a blog post on what I learned in my past experience which could help you if
                      you are looking for a referral from somebody you know for a long time on LinkedIn.</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: large; color: black">If you are reading this,
                      chances are you want to obtain a
                      referral from a person you already know, or maybe you are just trying out texting the HRs of the
                      company you are interested in. Either way, you will need to do few things before even reaching
                      out to those people who might open up a great future for you.</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: large; color: black"></span></p>
                  <br />
                  <h4 style="text-align: left;"><b><span style="font-family: helvetica; color: black">#1 - Build up
                        your portfolio
                        first.</span></b></h4>
                  <p><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: large; color: black">I literally mean, your
                      LinkedIn profile should have crisp
                      details and all the information needed for a viewer at first glance. I can't stress this enough
                      - <b>"At first glance"</b>. You need to have a cover pic that describes the kind of skills you
                      possess or at least gives a positive impression. Your <b>"About"</b> section should have the
                      details about your areas of expertise, your email ID, and demo links if you have done any
                      projects and hosted them online. Also, describe your passion towards the work area. It helps to
                      connect better.</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: large; color: black">Attachments play a big role
                      too. Make sure to attach your
                      CV in your profile's featured section and that the viewer is able to download it if needed. I'm
                      sure you would be attaching your pdf version of the CV in your LinkedIn chat message when you
                      tried to text that person. But why should you leave out the profile visiting HRs whom you
                      yourself did not reach out to?&nbsp;</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: large; color: black">In the experience section,
                      give links to the products you
                      might have worked on and clearly mention the tech stack you had worked on in that company.
                      Clarity is everything. And the first impression is second to none.</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: large; color: black"></span></p>
                  <p></p>
                  <br />
                  <h4 style="text-align: left;"><b><span style="font-family: helvetica; color: black">#2 - &nbsp;Git
                        hub
                        repositories are noticed.</span></b></h4>
                  <p><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: large; color: black">Software developers
                      sometimes ask for referrals but forget
                      to put a link to their Github profile in the Resume. Also, your GitHub profile reflects your
                      enthusiasm and involvement in software development. You must also update your profile on Github
                      with your skillset, most commonly worked projects, and your passion. You may not believe this
                      but the Interviewer ( probably the one whom you are asking for a referral ) is going to notice
                      how much passion you have for coding. This is because they are looking for people whom they want
                      to work with every day. And having passionate people around will add up value and help in their
                      project deliverables and also help the team in various intuitive ways.</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: large; color: black">Now, coming to your
                      repositories on Github, feature the
                      ones you have worked on the most. Your code should be neatly organized in a standard folder
                      structure and you must follow guidelines. You may not believe this but as an interviewer myself,
                      when I get a resume from my HR, the first thing I do is check the first Github repository in the
                      profile and see if their coding style is good and if they have added proper configuration in the
                      project like linters and pre-commit hooks. Yes, this matters too ðŸ˜Š</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: large; color: black"></span></p>
                  <br/>
                  <h4 style="text-align: left;"><b><span style="font-family: helvetica;color: black">#3 - Know your
                        referring
                        buddy better.</span></b></h4>
                  <p><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: large; color: black">If you are randomly texting
                      someone and attaching your CV
                      to the chat, 9/10 times you won't get a reply because there are many people like you doing the
                      same. Just take a step back and imagine yourself in their shoes. Would you reply to 50 messages
                      a day? I mean, they have work to do and they are doing their best to help few people. They
                      cannot satisfy everyone out there in the world. Especially if they have a lot of connections,
                      they would get a lot of messages. This is why you should not only request the people who are
                      very popular. There are many people who are not so active on LinkedIn and there are higher
                      chances that they might reply to your message if they find it attractive.</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: large; color: black">Long story short, before
                      asking for a referral, please get
                      to know the person. Look at their posts and try to have a casual conversation and tell them that
                      you like their work. By directly jumping to the referral topic, it shows that you only care for
                      what you want and not appreciating the person who is helping people out there. I hope you know
                      where this is going. This is human psychology. They are also humans and they have emotions and
                      interests. They feel good when appreciated too. They are not referral web portals that just do
                      the job of registration. You will thank me later for this tip.</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: large; color: black"><br /></span></p>
                  <h4 style="text-align: left;"><b><span style="font-family: helvetica; color: black">#4 - Bring
                        quantitative
                        points &amp; facts.</span></b></h4>
                  <p><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: large; color: black">As much as your profile,
                      your approach, and words are
                      important, the facts that you bring along have a significant impact on the impression. I'm not
                      asking you to say that you own a patent or something crucial like that. You won't believe how
                      much simple things matter. For example, if you include a demo of a recent project you made, it
                      will be noticed for sure. Not just projects, you can add the number of open-source contributions
                      or pull requests you have raised. You can also include your stack overflow points. Many people
                      just use stack overflow when they need something. Very few people actively reply and solve the
                      problems on stack overflow. You will be noticed for that.&nbsp;</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: large; color: black">
                      Include the number of articles you have published in your work area. And also mention your
                      typical turn around time when you implemented some feature in the old company and showcase the
                      impact it caused to the company.

                        apply on the
                        company career page.</span></b></h4>
                  <p><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: large; color: black">I'm sure you are confused
                      when I say <b>"Don't apply on the
                        company career page"</b> because many have told you it is the official way.&nbsp;</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: large; color: black">Well, give me a minute and
                      let me explain.</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: large; color: black">When employees refer a
                      profile, it gets a higher priority
                      than profiles uploaded on career page by job seekers and so your chances of getting shortlisted
                      increases. This is the reason why you are probably asking for a referral in the first place. But
                      I told you <b>not</b> to upload your CV on the career page of the company because when the
                      employee tries to refer you, and the CV already exists in the system, many companies don't
                      accept duplicate entries. This is a disaster because they will not be able to refer you at that
                      point.&nbsp;</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: large; color: black">There is actually a hack for
                      this. They will need a
                      different email ID of yours to retry once again. But honestly, they would have lost interest in
                      referring after the failed attempt.</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: large; color: black">So please try to get a
                      referral by showing your skills and
                      don't hurry up and upload your profile on the company website career page. I hope this was
                      something you may not be aware of and I wish you all the best for your next big
                      step.&nbsp;</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: large; color: black">Remember, you need to work
                      for it and then gain some
                      insights, build few projects and make your profile worthy to look at. You will have a higher
                      chance of getting into that dream company of yours.</span></p>

                      profiles better but to look at all the requests without missing them. So if you have pinged me
                      on LinkedIn and have not got a reply. Please don't mistake that I am ignoring you. Register
                      yourself to the MSK referral program. Every Saturday I look at the excel sheet and see if there
                      are matching openings. I have already referred many and they have got in. I also forward worthy
                      profiles to my friends and colleagues of other companies in Bangalore too.</span></p>
