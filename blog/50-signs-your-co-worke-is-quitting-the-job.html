                  <h4>Dear reader,</h4>
                  <br />
                  In the IT industry, switching job is a common thing and should not be taken too seriously.<br />
                  Every now and then we see our co-workers send the "last day" email and leave the company due to
                  various
                  reasons. One reason is a better opportunity.<br />
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  There are so many signs that the co-worker will exhibit when they are about to leave or have decided
                  to
                  leave the company. I will wrap them into the following major signs that they exhibit and provide you
                  with
                  a deep analysis I'd highly recommend not to read only the headlines for the below points but to read
                  the
                  explanation as well because we are going to understand very deeply about what is going on.<br />
                  <br />
                  You also might want to check out my article below after reading this blog post.<br />
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Okay Let's begin,<br />
                  <br class="Apple-interchange-newline" />
                  I will refer your co-worker who is leaving the company as&nbsp;<b>"he"</b>&nbsp;in this entire blog
                  post
                  so that you can relate the situation better.<br />
                  <br />
                  
                  <br />
                  <b>Sign #1: He gets into trouble with management often.</b><br />
                  If he has decided to leave or has already put down papers, he constantly refuses certain management
                  decisions and gets into a 'cold war' with the management. This is because he just doesn't want to
                  agree
                  with the management anymore as he doesn't 'care' for the decisions made. And he doesn't want to
                  perform
                  the tasks that the management gives him anymore. This is a really good sign that he has checked out.
                  He
                  doesn't have the need to impress that management anymore because he neither needs a pay increment nor
                  needs a promotion anymore. Unless he truly has a passion for his work in the company, most of the
                  people
                  exhibit this behavior.<br />
                  <br />
                  <b>Sign #2: His performance/productivity is not as good as before.</b><br />
                  Performance is subjective to the individual but if he was performing really well all these days and
                  suddenly if it drops, he might have checked out already. This is because he doesn't find contributing
                  to
                  the project or the company useful anymore as he won't be there for too long to see the project's
                  progress/
                  success. Also, if the project will succeed in the future, it will not benefit him anyway. On the other
                  hand, if he was always a low performer, this would not be a sign for him leaving the company since he
                  was
                  a low performer all the time.<br />
                  
                  <br />
                  <b>Sign #3: He takes long vacations.</b><br />
                  All of a sudden he starts taking week offs and demands comp off vacations. he used to be very regular
                  to
                  the office but after he decided to leave the company, he starts taking more vacations so that he can
                  utilize all the vacation balance left before he moves out. The company provides a certain number of
                  vacations to each employee and there is no need to save those vacations anymore. He starts taking long
                  family trips and other reasons and applies for long vacations giving a new reason every time. This is
                  a
                  strong sign especially if he was the most regular person in the office since you have known him.<br />
                  <br />
                  <b>Sign #4: His attire gets professional.</b><br />
                  If he was not always dressing well (most of the developers dress casually nowadays) and suddenly
                  changes
                  to a more professional look, he might be attending interviews during lunch breaks or coffee breaks. He
                  might be attending an interview before coming to the office so he should be dressed for the occasion.
                  Don't get me wrong, he could be dressed for a lunch date. But if he dresses on a regular basis without
                  an
                  occasion, chances are, he might be looking out.<br />
                  
                  <br />
                  <b>Sign #5: His attitude towards co-workers changes suddenly.</b><br />
                  Since he has already decided to leave, he doesn't have to maintain a very good relationship with his
                  co-workers anymore and so his attitude towards them change as well. He no longer needs help from
                  others
                  to
                  perform tasks in the current project because he knows that he will stop working for the project
                  eventually. He knows that he has to once again start building good relationships in his next company
                  and
                  doesn't need to spend time maintaining relationships in the current company. He also doesn't feel the
                  need
                  to talk much with other co-workers. (something that he was doing earlier)<br />
                  <br />
                  <b>Sign #6: His office timings change and become stable.</b><br />
                  While most companies mention in the offer letter that the employee should be flexible to work outside
                  of
                  regular office hours when business demands, he doesn't have to follow that anymore since he won't be
                  there
                  for too long. He used to work late nights in the interest to achieve project deadlines but now he
                  doesn't
                  feel the need to do so. So he will make the office 9 - 6 job and refuses to work more than 9 hours as
                  specified in the offer letter. Also, he will not be willing to spend time during the weekends when the
                  project/business demands. This is because he has to attend/prepare for other interviews. So he needs
                  time
                  to read and gather the knowledge required to pass the interviews.<br />
                  
                  <br />
                  <b>Sign #7: His involvement in the project reduces.</b><br />
                  The project's success is no longer affected for his future. So his involvement also reduces as a
                  result.
                  It's not only about his future, but he also might not be getting enough time to involve deeply in the
                  project because he has to prepare for the interviews and it consumes a lot of his time too. Obviously,
                  he
                  cannot give invest all this time for the project work. He has different priorities now and he has to
                  choose what he wanted to work for. He also has to concentrate on what kind of work he might get the
                  future
                  company. Overall, he has less time for the project to work.<br />
                  <br />
                  <b>Sign #8: He doesn't want to showcase his work much.</b><br />
                  As he will be moving on, There is no need to showcase what he has done in the past, There's also no
                  need
                  to showcase himself for the work done. He is not expecting a pay scale rise anyway. Neither is he
                  expecting any promotion from the company. The need to showcase his work to the higher management is
                  not
                  existing anymore.<br />
                  
                  <br />
                  <b>Sign #9: He reduces involvement in social activities.</b><br />
                  Just let the project work he does not have the need to show his social involvement with His
                  colleagues.
                  There is no need to involve in Facebook posts or Replying to a slack channel. There's also no need to
                  write blog posts in the company's internal blog domain. There's no need to reply to the Queries asked
                  in
                  the internal domain. His Involvement in Microsoft Teams groups also reduces.His overall social
                  activity
                  reduces<br />
                  <br />
                  and ironically, ...<br />
                  <br />
                  <b>Sign #10: He is up-to-date with the latest technologies.</b><br />
                  Because he has been preparing for different interviews he's always up-to-date with the latest and
                  greatest
                  technologies. He starts writing syntactically correct code in the project work. In the past, he used
                  to
                  reference Google for getting the syntactically correct code. He has also developed so much of
                  knowledge
                  on
                  the technologies that are not relevant for the project. He knows in and out of the whole ecosystem.
                  Although he is not using all this gained knowledge to do the project work he is up-to-date. For
                  example,
                  if he is a software engineer, now he knows all the aspects of a project manager's work. He starts
                  taking
                  too much of notes for all the technology-related aspects.He's taking notes because he has to remember
                  all
                  that in the interview. Because in the interviews he will not be given a laptop or Google to write
                  code.<br />
                  
                  <br />
                  <b>Sign #11: He gets very active on LinkedIn</b><br />
                  Let's be honest, LinkedIn is not that of an appealing website. It is not as exciting as Facebook. If
                  somebody's spending time in LinkedIn should be a reason. You will find him spending long hours on
                  LinkedIn. He will be connecting to different people on LinkedIn. He will be applying to jobs
                  continuously.
                  He will start writing articles in LinkedIn. His LinkedIn profile is always up-to-date. His social
                  activities in other social media like Facebook, Twitter or YouTube reduces and concentrates on
                  LinkedIn
                  more. He starts liking articles from different companies and starts following different companies on
                  LinkedIn. His job profile is consistent between different websites. This is because he's keeping his
                  resume up-to-date. And the same resume is being used on different websites. So if you find him too
                  much
                  active on LinkedIn chances are he might have checked out. Or at least he's trying to leave.<br />
                  <b><br /></b> <b>Sign #12: He wants to attend meetups, conferences and training workshops.</b><br />
                  This is because he wants to keep himself up-to-date and current company is not giving him enough
                  information about these latest technologies. The only way to learn is by taking courses, attending
                  meetups
                  and the workshops. If he was a guy who has never attended or at least never was willing to attend any
                  training workshops, and all of a sudden is super excited about a new workshop, chances are, he might
                  be
                  leaving the company And he is getting prepared for it. Also, conferences and meetups are a great way
                  to
                  meet new people outside the company. And this also increases his social connectivity with all these
                  professionals. This will increase his chances to be accepted in a different company or getting a
                  different
                  role.<br />
                  
                  <br />
                  <b>Sign #13: He becomes very quiet at the desk.</b><br />
                  He becomes very quiet at the desk. He doesn't talk as much as before. This is because he's avoiding to
                  generate many relationships with the co-workers. He also doesn't want to encounter the situation where
                  he
                  maintains good relationships with many employees and he wants to leave the company so he doesn't want
                  to
                  get hurt either. He also doesn't want them to consume his time when he's preparing for the interviews.
                  He
                  might also don't want them to know that he's been preparing for the interviews.<br />
                  <br />
                  <b>Sign #14: He got a promotion recently.</b><br />
                  This is a shocker for a few people. Many of you will think that if he has got a promotion that is no
                  need
                  to leave the company. But studies have found that even this is the reason to leave the company. The
                  moment
                  he gets a promotion, He is also Awarded a lot of job offers which are better than the current company
                  or
                  the position that he is in. So in spite of the fact that he recently got a promotion and a raise, he
                  would
                  choose a different opportunity which is far better than the current one. He just cannot let it down.
                  So
                  this comes as a real shocker for different people.<br />
                  
                  <br />
                  <b>Sign #15: He has not received a promotion for a long time.</b><br />
                  The longer he becomes stagnant in the current role, The more he thinks to leave the company. Nobody
                  wants
                  to remain as a software engineer for more than four years. People want to grow along with the company.
                  So
                  if he is stagnant for a long time and he is not asking for the promotion, chances are, he might be
                  looking
                  out. He will certainly put papers once you get a good opportunity and doesn't even ask for the
                  promotion
                  in the current company.<br />
                  <br />
                  <b>Sign #16: His major friends have all left the company recently.</b><br />
                  So all his friends have left the company. This is definitely not the reason for him to leave. But he
                  has
                  been contacting them and getting to know about the different opportunities that are present outside of
                  this current company. Chances are,&nbsp; they might be giving him information which He is interested
                  in.
                  They might be pushing him to leave as well. Because they also want to work with them. They might be
                  influencing him with a lot of pay scale. And he gets interested in it and decides to leave.<br />
                  
                  <br />
                  <b>Sign #17: He gets into a war with co-workers.</b><br />
                  Since there is no reason for him to maintain good relationships with the core workers he decides to
                  enter
                  into a war with them whenever he finds a time to do so. He doesn't agree with their emotions and he
                  doesn't agree for their inputs for the current project. He tries to think about all the things that
                  have
                  happened in past and tries to take an action based on what has happened. It doesn't matter if the
                  co-worker starts to complain to the higher management because he's leaving the company anyway.<br />
                  <br />
                  <b>Sign #18: He starts delegating his work often.</b><br />
                  Because he doesn't want to do the project work anymore even though he knows how to do the work he will
                  start delegating to work to other workers in the company. This way he will also get a chance to
                  showcase
                  that he was the one working for the project. And also he was getting some extra time to prepare for
                  the
                  different interviews. He starts delegating every single work that the management gives to him. When

                  already know that he has the capability to do the work but is still dedicating the work chances are,

                  Whether it is completing office work in office time, or trying to spend some extra time at home for
                  the
                  office work. He starts complaining for everything. For example, in code reviews, he starts complaining
                  that he's getting unnecessary comments. He doesn't want to come early to the office. But he wants to
                  leave
                  early. He starts complaining that he is not provided enough respect in the company. So if he is
                  complaining about every single thing, he might have checked out.<br />

                  Even if the email is very very important, he will choose not to respond to it or even simply ignore
                  it.<br />
                  He does not want to be held accountable for anything that happens in the project. He also doesn't find
                  the
                  need to reply to emails on time. He even stops putting out of office messages in emails when he's not
                  there. He's not a professional as he used to be before. Moreover, if he starts responding to the
                  emails
                  he
                  will get even more work and it would cut his time for preparing for the interviews.<br />

                  Since he has reduced all his social activities in the company his friend circle also reduces as a
                  result.
                  It's not only because of that even he does not want to make more friends because he's leaving the
                  company
                  anyway. he doesn't want to get close with people that you're leaving. So you will find him having his
                  lunch alone many times. He would also reduce his coffee breaks with his friends and would much prefer
                  to
                  have coffee alone. He will also spend less time hanging out with his friends after office hours. This
                  will
                  allow him to prepare more for the upcoming interviews.<br />

                  his
                  friend&nbsp;circle outside the company especially for the company that he will work next. He starts
                  making
                  new friends who are very professional whether it be on LinkedIn, Facebook or face-to-face. This will
                  also
                  allow him to have more contacts. More professional contacts. Thus increasing his chances to be
                  considered
                  for a different role in a different company<br />
                  <b><br /></b> <b>Sign #22: He participates more in Hackathons outside the company.</b><br />
                  There are few companies that give out jobs for the people who have won hackathons. hackathons are a
                  great
                  way to participate and earn your rights to get a new job. The more he participates,&nbsp; the more
                  engaged
                  he is with the latest technologies and there are high chances that a company would see the work and
                  offer
                  a job for him. So if you find him learning cheat sheets in the interest of winning a hackathon outside
                  the
                  company, chances are. he might be looking out an interest from other companies based on what he has
                  showcased in the event. He can also add this in his LinkedIn profile.<br />

                  A
                  better job or a better role will demand a higher education. Sometimes in order to become a manager,
                  you
                  need to have MBA. So he would start pursuing MBA during the weekends remotely or by physically
                  attending
                  certain courses. He might also be pursuing higher education because of the life events that are going
                  to
                  happen for him in the future. Collecting all that, higher education implies higher pay and a better

                  might be looking out for jobs on Facebook too. Different recruiters start posting jobs on Facebook
                  groups
                  because Facebook groups are very popular. so he might find the right job that benefits him in the
                  future.
                  So just check out his activity on Facebook and the kind of groups that he's joining. He stays away
                  from
                  groups that are non-professional and just the groups that are not related to finding a job at

                  If he can contribute to different open source projects,&nbsp; his GitHub profile increases. Also, some
                  of
                  the companies&nbsp;demand that you have to have promoted or contributed to different open source
                  projects
                  for them to consider you as technically competent. He can also put all this information in his
                  LinkedIn
                  profile as well. So it's a double win. He will start giving pull requests to different projects that
                  are
                  not connected to the current company at all. He will start using different integrated development
                  environments and software development kits that&nbsp;are not&nbsp;related to the current project in
                  the

                  <b><br /></b> <b>Sign #26: He takes long coffee/lunch breaks.</b><br />
                  You will see him taking longer coffee breaks than usual. This is because he can take them as he is not
                  so
                  involved in the project anymore. Also, he always wanted to take long breaks but the project/ manager
                  did
                  not allow him to do so. Well, now he can. And he will usually start taking breaks more than 1 hour or
                  so.
                  This is a true sign especially if you have seen him taking fewer breaks in the past.<br />
                  
                  <b><br /></b> <b>Sign #27: He uses his mouse more than the keyboard</b><br />
                  Typically, in IT jobs, people use the keyboard more than the mouse. Because there will be a lot of
                  coding
                  work and the mouse is not a very good option for coding. If you see him using the mouse all the time
                  or
                  if
                  you hear mouse clicks all the time, he might be just passing time on youtube or facebook. This is
                  obviously due to the fact that he doesn't want to involve in the project work and is serving his
                  notice
                  period. You might not know that he is serving the notice period. Majority of the people do not want to
                  spend long hours on the project especially when they are serving their notice period. So yeah, mouse
                  clicks are definitely a sign.<br />

                  Don't get me wrong, the phone calls could be from his family during emergencies. But there will not be
                  an
                  emergency situation all the time. He might be getting phone calls from different recruiters due to the
                  result of him updating his resume / CV in different job seeking websites like monster.com. And if you
                  observe him leaving his desk to attend the phone calls and trying to find a private room to attend
                  these
                  phone calls, they could very well be from recruiters.<br />

                  He will suddenly start applying for vacation for the day by intimating his manager in the morning
                  saying
                  that he is very sick. But the very next day you will find him perfectly healthy as if nothing has
                  happened. This is because he had taken a&nbsp;vacation to attend a&nbsp;certain interview. I'm not
                  saying
                  this is the reason always, but if you observe this pattern all the time, there are high chances that
                  he
                  is
                  looking out for different opportunities.<br />

                  the
                  current company, he will definitely be a little bit sad that he now has to leave them all in the
                  interest
                  of a better opportunity. So if you see him a bit silent and sad for more than 30 days, he could be
                  serving
                  his notice period.<br />

                  to
                  generate passive income by doing certain jobs online or by trying to market a business that he owns.
                  All
                  this to provide a cushion for him in case he leaves the company and doesn't find a job quickly. These
                  cushions provide a way to take few risks in life. They sometimes lead to a huge success because when
                  you
                  take the risk, you could succeed in a big way.<br />

                  interviews.
                  And sometimes unknowingly, he will exhibit it during meetings no matter how much he tries to avoid
                  showcasing them. This is a good sign that he is taking crash courses outside office hours in the
                  interest
                  of onboarding to newer platforms or languages/frameworks/libraries.<br />

                  His usual activities also tend to be a bit secretive as he now has to attend phone calls in private
                  rooms
                  and has to take care that his laptop screen is covered and his rough paperwork is covered up. He
                  starts
                  installing screen filters so that a co-worker is unaware of which websites he is visiting and he
                  always
                  has to clear the browser history often so that he is not caught during presentations and meetings
                  where
                  he
                  would need to connect his laptop to the projector. So he will be a bit secretive on little things
                  where
                  secrecy was not required in the past.<br />
                  <b><br /></b> <b>Sign #34: He is trying to shift his house far from the campus.</b><br />
                  Unless he really loves to travel every day in traffic, there is not a really good reason to
                  unnecessarily
                  shift his house in a place that is too far away. He might have already got a different job and is
                  getting
                  ready to make the move by shifting his family as well. This could be false if a life event like
                  marriage
                  has happened recently. His house shifting could be because of that. If not, then he might have got a

                  Okay, there are few really good reasons to sell all the household items. One reason is moving to a new
                  house and another reason is to upgrade existing items like furniture. But if you suddenly see him
                  selling
                  all the house furniture and you observe some of the above-mentioned signs, then the reason could be to
                  shift to a different city/country as he got a better opportunity over there.<br />
                  <b><br /></b> <b>Sign #36: He starts suggesting other co-workers to quit.</b><br />
                  Suggesting/influencing other employees to quit is prohibited in most companies and is not entertained
                  in
                  some companies at all. So if he is doing this in spite of knowing the consequences, he is not backing
                  off
                  to think about the consequences. He has already checked out and it doesn't affect him much. He will
                  start
                  influencing especially if he has left the company due to a friction with the management or other
                  co-workers.<br />

                  He is now relieved from the project work, deadlines or even milestones. So when everyone on the team
                  is
                  busy and a bit tensed of the pending work before the deadline, you will find him happy and relieved as
                  if
                  the milestone is already met. This is especially a sign if you had previously seen him taking a lot of
                  effort and tension during project deadlines. He is now relieved from all his duties and doesn't really
                  have a reason to get tensed for the things that will not matter to him in the coming future.<br />
                  <b><br /></b> <b>Sign #38: He doesn't carry work tension to home.</b><br />
                  This is also related to the above sign. If you were really close to him and have known that he was
                  carrying his office work to home. If you have observed his parents yell about him working at home as
                  well,
                  and all of a sudden there is no work at home as he is no longer carrying it to home, he has checked
                  out
                  from the company. This is because people tend to carry work to home if the work is going to reward
                  them
                  in
                  the future. It is highly unlikely that people do office work at home for nothing.<br />
                  
                  <br />
                  <b>Sign #39: He complains about his economic status and debts he has.</b><br />
                  This is very tricky. If the reason for him to leave was a low salary hike, he might have had a fight
                  with
                  the management recently because of this and they might have disagreed to provide him with the salary
                  he
                  had expected. And one of his reasons for asking a salary raise is because of the loans and debts that
                  he
                  holds from the bank as his economical status id getting hurt. He will complain about his own status as
                  he
                  needs more money due to various responsibilities. So if he is complaining about it all the time, he
                  will
                  either look out for a different high paying job soon or has already checked out.<br />
                  <b><br /></b> <b>Sign #40: He complains about work-life balance.</b><br />
                  Everybody needs work-life balance, but not everybody exhibits it publicly. This is because if you
                  exhibit
                  it, it would mean that you are not able to complete office work in the office and it is a question of
                  your
                  performance/productivity in office work. So people tend to hide this need of achieving work-life
                  balance.
                  But, if you see him complaining about it publicly, he is just trying to find out reasons to go home
                  early
                  as the project is not valuable to him anymore. And yeah, he has checked out of the company too.<br />
                  
                  <b><br /></b> <b>Sign #41: He had a major life event/change.</b><br />
                  Some employees tend to change their profession along with a major life event like marriage. This is
                  because more responsibilities will be added in life and they need to accommodate enough expenses as a
                  result. The company they are in may not be paying that much to satisfy the need. This doesn't happen
                  with
                  all but if you have observed many of the above-mentioned signs and in conjunction, a major life event
                  has
                  happened in his life, he could leave the company as a result and will start exhibit more of these
                  symptoms.<br />
                  <b><br /></b> <b>Sign #42: He stops giving innovative ideas to the team/project.</b><br />
                  What's the point in giving out innovative ideas and make the project a grand success when he knows
                  that
                  he
                  will not be at the bar when they celebrate after the success? He will not be a part of the success
                  story
                  either in the end.&nbsp; Instead, he will start using his innovation is different areas that will
                  benefit
                  him in the future like participating is hackathons as I mentioned earlier. He could be very innovative
                  at
                  home trying to freelance and generate passive income. But for the project, not so much.<br />
                  
                  <b><br /></b> <b>Sign #43: He doesn't help his team during roadblocks.</b><br />
                  If he is a senior engineer and you have always seen him helping others in resolving their roadblocks,
                  and
                  if he stops helping all of a sudden and starts delegating the tasks to an even junior employee, then
                  it
                  is
                  a sign that he doesn't care about the project anymore and is not willing to give a hand in resolving
                  the
                  on-going project related roadblocks which are leading the project to miss the deadlines.<br />
                  <b><br /></b> <b>Sign #44: There are rumours about him leaving</b><br />
                  Isn't this the obvious one? Rumours are still valid when they come from different sources. If he has
                  told
                  some of his close friends that he has applied resignation papers, they might have told others too and
                  the
                  rumour has begun. If you hear from many other co-workers about him leaving, it could be true.<br />
                  
                  <br />
                  <b>Sign #45: He starts doing freelancing work at freelancers.com.</b><br />
                  Websites like freelancers.com are very popular these days and they generate a lot of passive income.
                  passive income is very good and it frees you from working hard and gives you more time to live with
                  your
                  family. If you see him logging into such websites often even though there is a lot of work in the
                  company's project, he is definitely freelancing and is preparing to quit the company soon.<br />
                  <b><br /></b> <b>Sign #46: He is actively involved in getting is Passport/Visa.</b><br />
                  Unless he has been assigned an onsite travel or he has planned a trip with his family. If he is
                  actively
                  involved in getting his visa and the management has no clue why? (assuming that he hasn't sent
                  vacation
                  invite for the trip) , he is definitely moving to a different company for a different
                  opportunity.<br />
                  
                  <b><br /></b> <b>Sign #47: He starts playing indoor-outdoor games, computer games in the
                    office.</b><br />
                  So you always have seen him work and now he is participating in all sorts of games and starts even
                  playing
                  using the office&nbsp;laptop or his mobile phone more than usual, he is definitely lost interest and
                  focus
                  on the project due to the fact that he is now moving out of the company.<br />
                  <br />
                  <b>Sign #48: He starts marketing his business.</b><br />
                  So he starts marketing some other business that he is planning to start or one that he already owns,
                  he
                  is
                  doing so because he wants to attract certain potential clients and grow the business so that he can
                  get
                  relieved from his duties in the current company. This is a strong sign of him trying to become an
                  entrepreneur (especially if he is also pursuing an MBA course)<br />
                  
                  <b><br /></b> <b>Sign #49: He starts praising other companies</b><br />
                  Obviously, if he is not satisfied with his current work, he will start praising other companies and
                  will
                  yell about the salary that is currently being paid in the market. He will start these discussions and
                  will
                  have long 1 on 1s with his manager and they don't go pretty well either. These are very strong signs
                  that
                  he is planning to jump off the ship.<br />
                  <b><br /></b> <b>Sign #50: He is checking salary slabs on glassdoor.com</b><br />
                  One of the strong reasons why an employee jumps ships is the salary demand and the need for a
                  raise.<br />
                  So he wants to check how much other companies are paying and whether he is being paid well in the
                  current
                  company versus the market. He will bookmark glassdoor.com and will constantly check it as and when a
                  new
                  company calls for an interview.<br />
                  <br />
                  So overall, if an employee is looking out for a job change and gets interview call letter from a
                  company,
                  the very first thing he will do is check the company profile online in Wikipedia or Glassdoor. And get
                  to
                  know about the salary offered and the role that they areofferingg for the experience.<br />
