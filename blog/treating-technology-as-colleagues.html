                <h4>Dear reader,</h4>
                <br />
                <div>
                  As a software developer, you often interact with various different tools, programming languages and
                  your
                  co-workers.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Notice that I mentioned all of them in a single sentence.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  A lot of times, these tools you use will help you get certain tasks done. Just like how you ask help
                  from your co-workers who help you to get things done. Well, then why can't we treat these tools and
                  technologies as your colleagues?
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Absolutely we can.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  In fact, we can even imagine a professional management hierarchy of technologies. Just like how you
                  have
                  engineers reporting to a manager, managers reporting to a director and so on, we can imagine an
                  organization that is made up of software solutions built with various technologies.
                  <br />
                  Now,
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Since we are thinking in the perspective of tools and technologies helping us in day-to-day work life
                  in
                  a software company, we can recognize people with a technology they have expertise in or the language
                  they are working in.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  This way, when you need any support / help when you face any roadblock, you know which tool is
                  relevant
                  to get the job done and which technology / language will be able to assist you.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  It might me a bit confusing right now, but stick with me.
                  <br />
                  
                  <br />
                  So Java sits with Git and Git will help java when java wants to re-base 5 commits and then Python will
                  pull the data out of the jenkins build for analysis. Meanwhile Android will ask HTML to chat over a
                  coffee where they will discuss how to leverage Fire base.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  It sounds funny but really that's who we are in this software world. We need to communicate to the
                  right
                  people around us to get the right information. Many times, you will want to know what your colleague
                  is
                  working on rather than their names during project work.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  And outside of project work, they become normal people you interact with.
