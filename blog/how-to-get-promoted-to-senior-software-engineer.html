                              If you are looking forward to becoming a senior engineer, get the mindset of taking up
                              more
                              responsibilities. Life ain't easy. It only gets harder. But as we grow in any industry,
                              our
                              skills get evolved as well and we tend to uplift ourselves to senior positions.<br />
                              We need to keep evolving cuz that's what life is all about. We take newer, harder
                              challenges
                              and achieve them. Once we achieve them, we get that personal satisfaction. Once we get
                              personal satisfaction, we will be ready for the next level.<br />
                              <br />
                              I hope this post has given you enough insights on how to improve yourself and get
                              promotion
                              next time.<br />
                              <br />
